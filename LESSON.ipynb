Camp instructions will tell how to obtain the book.\n\nStudents are encouraged to learn from the entire book.  This lessons is focused learning about basic Linux security (Chapter 9: Permissions) and (Chapter 16:Networking).  We will briefly cover Chapters 1-6 for students completely new to Linux.\n\n## Connecting to Linux system\nThe camp will provide access to a Linux system.  Specifically it is an instance of Kali running in AWS.  Login instructions will be provided in your camp materials. \n\nConnecting to the Linux system requires the use of SSH.  The Chrome browser extension \"Secure Shell\" will allow you to access the Linux from within your browser. \n[Secure Shell extension in Google

for your home directory or `/home/ken` for user `ken`\n\nTry some basic commands  \n- data  \n- cal  \n- df  \n- free  \n\nKeyboard shortcuts  \n- After typing enough of a command or filename to make it unique you can use the `tab` key to complete.  \n- The `up arrow` can be used to recall past commands  \n- The `history` command will your past commands\n- `!!` will execute the last command in your history    \n- `!#` will execute the command numbered in your history  \n- `!name` will execute the last command strating with `name`\n\nWhile using history can be convenient, you need to remember that if you type passwords or other secrets on the command line they be remembered in your history and potentially visible to other users.\n"},{"metadata":{},"id":"nasty-discussion","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Chapter 2: Navigation\n\n- `pwd` Print name of current working directory  \n- `cd` Change directory  \n- `ls` List

\n\nThere is a user `peppapig`on the system. She is friendly (and not so serious about security) and shares readable and writable files and directories.  The following commands look at a few ways you interact with Peppa's files.  \n\nThe first step all attackers is recon.  These commands allow us to move to Peppa's home directory (often home directories are readable).  We can read some files.  Can you explain the difference in file permissions?  If not, the book will help.\n\n```\ncd /home/peppapig\nls -l\nmore public_quote\nmore private_quote\n```\nReading files in another user's home directory happens when all the users on that system are collaborating as team.  Not good for privacy but great for sharing.  \nShould we be able to write things into Peppa's home directory?\n\nThe next commands show we can.  Can you explain why?\n\n```\necho \"O George!\" > myname.quote\necho \"O George!\" > studentPlayground/myname.quote\nls studentPlayground/\n```\n\nOK, back to your home directory.  In the \"old days\" we used FTP.  Passwords in the clear, bad, Bad, BAD! Today, we use scp.  It works like the `cp` command but allows use to copy from/to other systems like FTP.  \n`cp sourceFile destinationFile`\nscp adds user@host:\n`scp user@host:sourceFile user@host:destinationFile`\n\nThe following commands all have the same result, if you are user `george` working in george's home directory.  \nGive a few a try, replacing \"ken\" with your username.\n\n```\ncd ~\ncp /home/peppapig/public_quote /home/george/mycopy\ncp /home/peppapig/public_quote mycopy\nscp george@kali.cyberunh.org:/home/peppapig/public_quote george@kali.cyberunh.org:/home/george/mycopy\nscp kali.cyberunh.org:/home/peppapig/public_quote george@kali.cyberunh.org:mycopy\nscp george@kali.cyberunh.org:~/../peppapig/public_quote mycopy\nscp kali.cyberunh.org:/home/peppapig/public_quote .\n\n```\nYou can also use scp to write, assuming you have the permissions.   \nCreate a file with a fun quote in your home directory than move it to Peppa's playground folder.\n```\ncd ~\necho \"Add a fun quote here\" > george.quote\nscp george.quote kali.cyberunh.org:studentPlayground/\n```\nDid your quote show up in the playground?\n```\nls -l /home/peppapig/studentPlayground/\n```"},{"metadata":{},"id":"wicked-hamilton","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Extra-credit:\nCan other users read the contents of your home directory?

The math behind hashing is a Ph.D. level discussion.  What we need to know is:\n1) MD5 and SHA are good time-tested algorithms\n2) Hash algorithms reduce a (file|string) to a unique and small set of bits\n3) The hash algorithm is not reversable\n\nThis makes hashing great for storing passwords.  If attackers get the password list they can't reverse the hash to get the password.  With one BIG caveat. Your password is unique enough that someone hasn't put the hash of your password in a in list.\n\nThe MD5 hash of `password` is `5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99`.  Google the hash and now you know the origin is `password`\n\nThe commands below hash a number of strings using MD5.  Storing all the hashes in a file.  We add `.salted` to a few password as some randomish text to hopefully fool Google and cracking tools.  \n```\necho -n \"george\" | md5sum > hashes\necho -n \"george.salted\" | md5sum >> hashes\necho -n \"badpassword\" | md5sum >> hashes\necho -n \"password\" | md5sum >> hashes\necho -n \"password.salted\" | md5sum >> hashes\nmore hashes\n```\nThe tool we going to use to guess the passwords is John the Ripper.    We have a small clean up edit to put your hash file into a format John likes.  The `rockyou.txt` file is a list of the 14 million most popular passwords. \n```\nsed -i 's/ -//g' hashes\nmore hashes\njohn --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=Raw-MD5 hashes\nmore ~/.john/john.pot\n```\nWhich passwords did John find?\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"id":"surgical-response","cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Extra credit \n\nHash your goto password.
